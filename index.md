## EUR Data Coffee Breaks

### How do the Breaks work?
The EUR Data Coffee Breaks are monthly online presentations around research data management. The meetings are short, focused, and informal. Every meeting one topic will be discussed. The same presentation will be held twice a month, so that many EUR researchers can join one of the monthly sessions.
We start the meetings with a 10-15 minutes presentation, followed by 15 minutes of questions and discussion.
Nothing more than a 30 minute coffee break! But please bring your own coffee, tea and cookies.

### What topics will be covered?
Most topics will be presented by one of the Research Data Stewards, but if needed guests will be invited for more specialized topics. Please contact Eduard for suggestions for other topics or speakers!
These short presentations are of course nothing more than starting points, in-depth support and training will be organised when needed.

### Contact and further materials
