# EUR Data Coffee Breaks

The EUR Data Coffee Breaks are short, focused, and informal presentations around Research Data Management (RDM). Each month is dedicated to a different RDM topic, and each topic is presented twice. EUR researchers can join either an online or hybrid session (via [this Teams link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODg5N2ZlNzMtNmY5Yi00NmEzLWJmZDktOTkwYTI2ZGRjZDA0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22715902d6-f63e-4b8d-929b-4bb170bad492%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%229fce85bf-ab82-4f9c-9912-c8da2849fab6%22%7d)) that takes place on Monday or Thursday, respectively. The presentations start with a 10–15-minute presentation, followed by 15 minutes for questions and discussion. These short presentations are of course nothing more than starting points, but we are happy to organize in-depth support and training when needed. The sessions are not recorded, but slides will be published after the session.  
 
### What topics will be covered?

Most themes are presented by the Research Data Stewards, but we welcome guests to present more specialized topics. Do you have suggestions for a topic or a speaker? Please get in touch via datasteward at eur.nl  

In 2022, the Data Coffee Breaks were first organized at the Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences as [ESSB Data Coffee Breaks](https://my.eur.nl/en/essb-employee/research-support/research-data-management). For some of the topics covered see the presentations in the [EUR Research Data Stewardship community](https://zenodo.org/communities/eur_research_data_stewardship/) on Zenodo (in the schedule below you can find links to some of those presentations under **Materials**).
